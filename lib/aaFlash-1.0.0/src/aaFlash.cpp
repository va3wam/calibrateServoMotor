 * @mainpage the Aging Apprentice flash memory class 
 * 
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is an Arduino class that saves variables to flash memory to preserve
 * information through a reboot. This is part of a series of classes made 
 * to support a standard set of APIs for robot platforms. 
 *
 * @section dependencies Dependencies
 * 
 * This class depends on on <a href="https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32">
 * Arduino.h</a> being present on your system. This is the Arduino core library
 * that comes bundled with PlatformIO.

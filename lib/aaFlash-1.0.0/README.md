## Overview
This repository contains an Arduino class that writes variables to permanent
memory to retain values through reboots. This is part of a series of classes 
made to support a standard set of APIs for experimental robot platforms. 

## Dependencies
This class depends on <a href="https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32">
Arduino.h</a> being present on your system. This is the Arduino core library
that comes bundled with PlatformIO.

## Author
Written by Old Squire for the Aging Apprentice.

## Development environment
This library was written using the following tools:
* [<img src="/img/vscLogo.png" width="15" height="15">](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) 
Microsoft's Visual Studio Code source code editor. 
* [<img src="/img/pioLogo.png" width="20" height="15">](https://platformio.org/) 
PlatformIO plugin 
[embedded software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_software) application 
[IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). 

<span style="color:green">suggestion:</span> If you are using the standard 
Arduino IDE for your project then you should probably avoid using this library 
unless you are comfortable navigating the subtle differences bewteen how your 
envoronment bahaves and how the environment used to create this library behaved.

## Code documentation
As part of our CI/CD software development process we use 
[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to automatically generate
up-to-date documentation via [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) every 
time the **main** branch gets updated. The output from Doxygen is placed in the 
**root** diretory of the **gh-pages** branch. This repository has an associated 
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site that contains all of the Doxygen
tags and assorted embedded comments from the code itself. This documentation 
can be viewed in your web browser 
[here](https://theagingapprentice.github.io/aaFlash/html/index.html).    

## Microprocessor compatibility
This library has only been tested on the 
[Adafruit Huzzah32](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather) 
development board containing the 
[Espressif ESP WROOM32 SOC](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf) 
featuring a pair of [Cadence/XtensaÂ®32-bit LX6 microprocessors](https://mirrobo.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cadence_Tensillica_Xtensa_LX6_ds.pdf). 

## Installing
These instructions assume that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on 
your computer.

1. Navigate to the Arduino project directory on your computer.
2. Issue the command `git clone https://github.com/theAgingApprentice/aaChip.git`.
3. Issue the command `git remote`. If you get back the response *origin* then 
you are all set. If you get a blank response back then you must set up an 
association to the remote repository by issuing the command `git remote add 
origin https://github.com/theAgingApprentice/aaChip.git` to set up the remote. 

## Running tests
As part of our CI/CD software development process we want to run automated tests 
every time new code is pushed to the main branch. To date we have not managed to
do this though we have experimented with the PlatformIO C/C++ unit testing tool 
called [unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity). We have a dummy script
called [test_main.cpp](test/test_main.cpp) located located in the test directory 
off the root of the repository. This test does nothing useful at the moment and
it may not even make sense to run tests on a class such as this. Full 
instructions on how to write and run these test can be found on the PlatformIO 
website 
[here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/tutorials/espressif32/arduino_debugging_unit_testing.html#writing-unit-tests). 
If you wish to run the tests you must do so manally while in Visual Studio Code 
and PlatformIO:

1. Click the PlatformIO Icon in the Visual Studio Code Activity bar along the left
hand side of your screen.
2.  Expand the Advanced menu item.
3.  Click the Test menu item.

The tests will then run and show you results like this.

```
test/test_main.cpp:58:test_string_concat        [PASSED]
test/test_main.cpp:59:test_string_substring     [PASSED]
test/test_main.cpp:60:test_string_index_of      [PASSED]
test/test_main.cpp:61:test_string_equal_ignore_case     [PASSED]
test/test_main.cpp:62:test_string_to_upper_case [PASSED]
test/test_main.cpp:63:test_string_replace       [PASSED]

```

We are also looking at PlatformIO's support of 
[Github Actions](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ci/github-actions.html) 
to see what can be accomplished for Arduino projects. We do not want to pay to 
use TravisCI. 

## Releases
* We use the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) numbering scheme for our releases. 
* The latest stable release is [v1.0.0](https://github.com/theAgingApprentice/aaFlash/releases/tag/v1.0.0). 

## Examples
There is an 
[example sketch](https://github.com/theAgingApprentice/aaFlash/blob/main/examples/simpleExample/simpleExample.cpp) 
that shows you how to use this class.

* Adafruit for their excellent freely available tutorials.

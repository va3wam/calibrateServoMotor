# This file is used by git to determine which files should be ignored when
# tracking changes to push to the origin. Note that Git only ignores files 
# that are not part of the repository yet. If you already git added some 
# files, their changes will still be tracked. To remove those files from your 
# repository (but not from your file system) use git rm --cached on them. 
# Patterns and full names of files and directories to be ignored by Git are 
# grouped together under the heading of the tool that uses these files to make
# it easier to follow what is going on.
